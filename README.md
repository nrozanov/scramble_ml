Comparison of random and qlearning algorithms efficiency in solving sliding puzzle game  
To launch comparison run core.py 2 10 (in this example board size is 2x2, number of runs is 10)  
Please use values from 2 to 3 as game dimension (bigger boards should be solved using other algorithms e.g local value iteration)
